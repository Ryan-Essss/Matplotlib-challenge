## Matplotlib - The Power of Plots
Pandas and Matplotlib

This projects goals are to merge and clean data to generate summary statistics of treated tumor growth in mice.
The statistics are then used to generate Bar and Pie charts to decide the top treatment groups.

Final tumor volume is calculted across the 4 top treatments groups and plotted in Box and Whisker plots.
A mouse is chosen and a line plot is made for tumor volume vs time point.  Addiontally, a scatter plot 
of the mouse's weight and average tumor volume is plotted with the linear regression model.
